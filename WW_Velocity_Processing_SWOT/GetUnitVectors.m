% function [bX,bY,bZ]=TdsGetUnitVectors(phi,azi,pitch,roll);
% 
% Get the three unit vectors of a beam that has the attitude given by
% phi, azi, pitch and roll.
%
% All angles are in radians...
% phi: the angle the beam makes from the horizontal plane.  Positive is
%   upwards.  Nominal is -pi/3;    
% azi: the angle the beam makes from the starboard of the ship.
%   Positive is counter clockwies.  nominal is (3 1 7 5)*pi/2.  
% pitch: the angle the bow of the ship is roated about the x axis.
%   Positive is bow upwards. 
% roll: the angle the bow of the ship is rotated about the y axis.
%   Positive is port rail upwards.  
%
% For this the pitch is applied first and then the roll.  This is correct
% for the TSS on the Revelle.
%
% It is also correct for the PHINS on the Revelle, which has replaced the
% TSS (April 2005).
